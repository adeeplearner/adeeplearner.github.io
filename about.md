Thank you for reading this far!

## About me
I am a Researcher in Deep Learning/Computer Vision. This is my personal blog, a place where I explore, learn and write about random things in my spare time. 

Okay, so a little bit about myself. I grew up in an era when computers (read 'robots') were beginning to take over the world. This allowed me to see all the transitions from their use as a basic word processor all the way to driving cars and landing space rockets. I always have had the curiosity and urge (unluckily for many gadgets that didnt survive this) to dig deeper and try to understand how things work. Hopefully I will have sometime to explore and write about some in this blog.

## About the blog
This blog is intended to capture random notes on topics I look at in my spare time (mostly on weekends when I am off from work). The intention is for me to keep a record for my future self, and also learn new topics by writing about them.
